/**
 * \brief A structure aware memory allocator.
 *
 * Nalloc is a nested replacement of for the standard memory allocation
 * functions, tracking the natural structure aware tree-like representation
 * of memory dependencies. Freeing a alloced chunk of memory would release
 * all of its dependencies.
 *
 * @note You can not mix malloc and nalloc families of functions for
 *       a given chunk of memory. Once a chunk is allocated with *nalloc*,
 *       it can only be freed with *nfree*.
 *
 * Use:
 * @code
 *   struct matrix { size_t rows, cols; int **data; };
 *   struct matrix *matrix_new(size_t rows, size_t cols) {
 *       struct matrix *m = ncalloc(sizeof(*m), NULL);
 *       m->rows = rows; m->cols = cols;
 *       m->data = ncalloc(rows * sizeof(*m->data), m);
 *       for (size_t i = 0; i < rows; i++)
 *           m->data[i] = nalloc(cols * sizeof(**m->data), m->data);
 *       return m;
 *   }
 *   void matrix_delete(struct matrix *m) { nfree(m); }
 * @endcode
